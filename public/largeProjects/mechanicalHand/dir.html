  <h2>3D Printed Mechanical Hand With Human Based Physiology</h2>
  <p>As a final project for a computer aided design and fabrication class I designed and 3D printed a human based hand that used motorized tendons to provide semi realistic movement and a similar range of motion to a human hand.</p>
  <p>The largest design challenge was designing a system that allowed each section of the fingers to close simultaniously and still maintain a realistic range of motion for all the fingers. I designed a joint that allows the tendon to move freely between the two sections and angled connections to stop the sections at the ends of rotation without severe increase in friction</p>
