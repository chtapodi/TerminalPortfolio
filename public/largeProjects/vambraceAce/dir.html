  <h2>Body Heat Seebeck Generator</h2>
  <p>At the 2016 Cleantech Hackathon in Troy, NY, I and several other team members, made a wearable band that traps the majority of the body heat within the encompassed area and uses the Seebeck effect to generate small amounts of electricity, which when stored up in a large capacitor, discharges with enough current to pass through a joule thief, producing enough voltage to trickle charge a LiPo battery. We used a variety of materials to get optimal temperature differential, including copper cloth and thermal paste. </p>
  <p>We have been given the Presidential Green Grant from Union College to continue development on this project, focusing on the aspects of thermal retention, power amplification, and ergonomic design.</p>
